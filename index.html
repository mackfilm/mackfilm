          Mack, an introspective twenty-something, encounters difficulties — even
          absurdities — at work and in his dating life. He meets a homeless man who
          considers himself Jesus Christ, and the two develop an odd friendship.
          Meanwhile, a young monk undergoes struggles similar to Mack's, and their
          stories increasingly converge.
