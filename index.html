      'Where was it,' Raskolnikov thought, as he walked on, 'where was it that I
      read of how a condemned man, just before he died, said, or thought, that if
      he had to live on some high crag, on a ledge so small that there was no more
      than room for his two feet, with all about him the abyss, the ocean, eternal
      night, eternal solitude, eternal storm, and there he must remain, on a hands'
      breadth of ground, all his life, a thousand years, through all eternity--it
      would be better to live so, than die within the hour? Only to live, to live!
      No matter how--only to live!... How true! Lord, how true! How base men are! ..
      and he is worse who decries them on that account!' he added, a minute later.
